# linearRegressionAlgorithm
In linearRegression.py you will find the algorithm, to use it:
a) set the values of your dataset, you can change the code to fetch it for you more easily

b)make the first guess, the algorithm will self improve as it iterates, finding a local minimum based on the first condition

(remember, the linear formula is y = t1*x + t0)
c) set the number of iterations and the learning condition

(the learning condition will self-update throughout the iterations)
d) as a result it will print out a graphic with the dataset points and the linear function it best found

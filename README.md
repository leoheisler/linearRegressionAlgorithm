# linearRegressionAlgorithm
In linearRegression.py you will find the algorithm, to use it:
a) set the values of your dataset, you can change the code to fetch it for you more easily<br>

b)make the first guess, the algorithm will self improve as it iterates,<br> 
finding a local minimum based on the first condition<br>

(remember, the linear formula is y = t1*x + t0)<br>
c) set the number of iterations and the learning condition<br>

(the learning condition will self-update throughout the iterations)<br>
d) as a result it will print out a graphic with the dataset points and the linear function it best found<br><br>
